## Supported Things

### JUNG ZLL5004m

The JUNG ZLL5004m is a battery powered wall switch with 8 buttons. The top row acts as on/off on press as well as dimming up and down on longpress.
The other 6 buttons recall scenes.
To connect the device to nymea, start with factory resetting the remote by pressing and holding buttons 5 and 6 (3rd row, left and right) down simultaneously
until the remote starts blinking, then press the off button. Then permit new devices to join the ZigBee network and press and hold button 2 and 7 (top-right
and bottom-left) until the remote starts blinking.
After the remote has joined the nymea network, the remote can also be directly linked to light bulbs by holding it close to a light bulb and pressing and
holding buttons 1 and 8 (top-left and bottom-right) until the remote and the light start blinking. The remotes buttons will now control the light directly
as well as sending its button presses to nymea for further processing.
